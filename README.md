# data-structures-projects

These projects are part of the coursework done at CMU for 95-771.

Project 1 - This project has three objectives. First, building linked list data structure. Second, use the linked list class created in Part 1 to implement Merkle-Hellman Knapsack cryptography. Third, use the same linked list to build a Merkle Tree.

Project 2 - 2D-Tree implementation

Project 3 - Red Black trees

Project 4 - Hamiltonian cycle

Project 5 - LZW Compression
